## Description

RollDiceGame uses dicefullApi to get images of the dices and updates its value. You need to guess if the next number on the dice will be lower of higher. There is also a game history saving all rounds. The data is stored in local storage so if you wish to close it and then finish it will ask you to load the previous game if you wish so.
